NAME

    Sub::Alias - Simple subroutine alias.

VERSION

    This document describes Sub::Alias version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

        use Sub::Alias;
    
        sub name { "David" }
        alias get_name => 'name';
    
        print get_name; # "David"

DESCRIPTION

    This module does a compile-time code injection to let you define
    subroute aliases with their names, but not code refs.

    The not-so-scarily-described way to alias a sub looks like this:

        sub name { "..." }
        *get_name = \&name;

    As you can see, it's a bit of trouble to type the whole line without
    without making your finger jammed unless you're using some smart text
    editors.

INTERFACE

    alias $new_name => $old_name

      This function is exported by default.

      The alias subroutine can be referenced by its name:

          alias get_name => 'name';

      Or by its reference:

          alias get_name => \&name;

      Also notice that doing this will actually call the name function:

          alias get_name => name;

      However, get_name will still be an alias to name funciton after this
      statement.

      It is recommended that you just pass function names as strings.

      NOTICE: If your new name depends on runtime data:

          alias $new_foo => \&foo;

      You need to put them in a single line alone.
