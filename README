NAME

    Sub::Alias - Simple subroutine alias.

VERSION

    This document describes Sub::Alias version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

        use Sub::Alias;
    
        sub name { "David" }
        alias get_name => 'name';
    
        print get_name; # "David"

DESCRIPTION

    This module does a compile-time code injection to let you define
    subroute aliases by names or code refs.

INTERFACE

    By <use Sub::Alias>, an new keyword 'alias' is introduced in the scope.
    Let's say there is an existing subroutine named "wine" and we want to
    create an alias to it named "vino".

    The following 2 ways should be trivial to understand:

        # By name
        alias vino => "wine";
    
        # By code reference
        alias vino => \&wine;

    The first argument can be a scalar variable containing the new name:

        my $n = "vino";
        alias $n => \&wine;

    Complex exressions that computes a new name is not supported.

DEPENDENCIES

    Keyword::Declare

INCOMPATIBILITIES

    Perl versions older than 5.12 are not supported.
